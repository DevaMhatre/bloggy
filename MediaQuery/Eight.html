            <h2>Ben as "RipJaws"
                <hr> <br>
            </h2>

            <p>Ripjaws shares a number of traits with Earth's aquatic life, such as an alligator, an eel, a leech,[merch
                1] an anglerfish, and a shark. He can change between a fishtail with triangular lines or legs at will
                and has a phosphorescent light on his head.
            </p> <br>

            <p>
            <p>
                In the Original Series, Ripjaws' body was mostly grey and he had four-fingered hands. He wore the
                original Omnitrix symbol on a black patch over his left pectoral.
                In Ultimate Alien, Ripjaws had a catfish-like face, green eyes with black pupils, chest plates similar
                to Humungosaur, three-fingered hands, a green lure, and green lips. His tail was colored grey like his
                skin and his fins were a darker shade of green than in the Original Series. He wore the Ultimatrix
                symbol on his chest.

                In the Ultimate Alien intro, Ripjaws looked almost the same as in the series proper except his tail was
                black, reflecting his appearance in the Original Series. His lips were also colored black and his lure
                was white.
                11-year-old Ripjaws appears almost exactly the same as he did in the Original Series, except his eyes
                and the Omnitrix symbol on his left upper torso are recolored green.
                Ripjaws' greatest weakness is that he cannot stay on land for too long. If Ripjaws wants to stay on
                land, he would require water or cool temperatures

            <h3>
                Kevin as Ripjaws


            </h3>

            Kevin's Ripjaws looked the exact same as Ben's did in the Original Series, but without an Omnitrix symbol.
            His black patch was also on his right upper torso.

            <h3>
                Weaknesses


            </h3>

            Ripjaws' greatest weakness is that he cannot stay on land for too long. If Ripjaws wants to stay on land, he
            would require water or cool temperatures to keep him from dehydrating. If he doesn't have water while on
            land, he could die. Exposure to extreme heat will cause Ripjaws to dehydrate quickly. </p> <br>
