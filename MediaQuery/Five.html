                In the Original Series, Grey Matter wore a white jumpsuit with a thin vertical black stripe down the front, his eyes were yellowish-green, his forehead had a larger version of the jumpsuit's stripe, and the original Omnitrix symbol was on his back.

In Ultimate Alien, Grey Matter looked exactly the same as before, except his skin was slightly lighter, his eyes were green and he wore the Ultimatrix symbol on his chest.

In Omniverse, Grey Matter now has a green jumpsuit with a black belt. His suit collar is now black, and the stripe on his head and jumpsuit are no longer present. He wears black, fingerless gloves with a green rectangle on the back. His neck is slightly longer, and his Omnitrix symbol has returned to his back.

11-year-old Grey Matter in Omniverse looks exactly the same as he did in the Original Series except his collar is black, his eyes are green, and his skin tone is slightly different.

                Gwen as Grey Matter had Gwen's hair and more oval-shaped eyes, with much smaller pupils. She wore a light blue jumpsuit with dark blue sleeves, and the Omnitrix symbol was on her back. She lacked the stripes Ben's Grey Matter has.
