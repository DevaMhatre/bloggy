                Ghostfreak is a phantom/ghost-like alien with a gaseous appearance and claw-like hands, and grey skin
                with black lines running all over him. His skin is removable with black and white striped tentacles
                underneath it.</p>

            <h2>Ben as "GhostFreak"
                <hr> <br>
            </h2>

            <p>In the Original Series, Ghostfreak's original Omnitrix symbol peeked out of his skin on his lower left
                chest and he had a pink eye with a black pupil.

                In Alien Force, Ghostfreak looked exactly like Zs'Skayr did in the same series, except his eye was green
                and the original Omnitrix symbol was on his chest.

                In Ultimate Alien, Ghostfreak looked like the enslaved Chimera Sui Generi from Ghost Town, but was more
                muscular. His eye was bigger and green with a black pupil, and the spikes on his elbows were gone.
                Ghostfreak wore the Ultimatrix symbol on his chest.

            </p> <br>

            <p>
            <p>
                In Omniverse, Ghostfreak now has green chains all over his front side which lead to his neck, waist, and
                center/chest, giving him the appearance of being contained in a straitjacket, but with his arms out
                freely. The spikes on his elbows have returned, his skin is now a greenish-white shading, and he has two
                cuffs on each of his arms. The Omnitrix symbol is located at the center of his chains. When possessing
                someone, he has a green glow. His tentacles are now black and purple-striped and his eye is colored
                green.

            <h3>
                Bad Ben as Bad Ghostfreak

            </h3>

            Bad Ben's Ghostfreak looks similar to Ben Prime's Ghostfreak in Omniverse, except the green parts of Bad
            Ben's version's body are colored mint green and his chains are colored blue-green.

                Powers and Abilities


            </h3>

            Ghostfreak can make himself intangible and invisible as both a powerful defense and a way of infiltrating
            high-security locations.Ghostfreak can choose to selectively make parts of himself corporeal or slightly
            corporeal. This extended technique can be used to interact with the world or fight while still intangible.
            It can also be used in a more deadly way by interacting with someone's internal body parts, such as causing
            a stroke by attacking Thumbskull's brain.
