        <div class="box" id="content" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><h2>Ben as "Diamond Head"<hr> <br></h2>
            
            <p>Being a silicon-based life form made of super-hard, green/blue diamond-like material, Diamondhead's body is composed of durable pale green crystals. He sports four crystal shards on his back and has a sharp head </p> <br>
                
            <p>
            <p>
                n the Original Series, Diamondhead wore a uniform that was black on the right half and white on the left with a black patch on the left shoulder where the original Omnitrix symbol was.

                In Back with a Vengeance, Diamondhead wore a yellow raincoat.
                
                In Destroy All Aliens, Diamondhead looked the same as in the Original Series, except his eyes had jewel-like facets and his outfit had detailed textures.
                
                In Race Against Time, Diamondhead's skin was semi-translucent. His skin was a darker shade of green while his bodysuit is more metallic with some patterns of spandax.

            </p> <br>
                
            <p>
                In Alien Force and Ultimate Alien, Diamondhead's lower body, torso, and the top of his head were similar to Chromastone's, consisting of indigo crystal which has black lines and dots over it. There were six crystal shards on his back instead of four and he also sported two more on the front of his chest. His eyes were green, and he wore the original Omnitrix/Ultimatrix symbol on his chest. Gwen Prime as Diamondhead shared these exact same traits.
                
                In Heroes United, Diamondhead had crystal blades on his forearms and his crystal skin looked more realistic due to being drawn in Generator Rex's art style. He also had a vertical black line in the middle of his face.
                
                In Omniverse, Diamondhead has clothing that is all black with one large green stripe down the middle up to his belt, and wears black pants. He has a green belt with white stripes on which he wears the Omnitrix symbol. Diamondhead no longer bears the crystals on his chest, and the crystals on his back have also grown in length. His jaw is larger, he wears black shoes with green on the bottom, and there are now only two crystal shards on his back.
                
                11-year-old Diamondhead looks almost the same as in the Original Series, but the left side of his suit is missing the black patch around the Omnitrix symbol and the crystals on his back, as well as his jaw, are bigger. His eyes are green and the Omnitrix is recolored.

                Kevin's Diamondhead looked the exact same as Ben's did in the Original Series, but without a black patch on the left side of his uniform. He also lacks an Omnitrix symbol.

                Negative Diamondhead looked exactly like Ben's Diamondhead in Alien Force and Ultimate Alien, except his eyes and Ultimatrix symbol were recolored red.

                Gwen 10's Diamondhead almost looks the same as her non-canon counterpart but is somewhat slimmer and is more bluish colored. Her eyes and original Omnitrix symbol are pink and she has a hairclip just like Gwen 10. Her outfit on the left side is different, as she now has a black patch on her left chest and a blue cat logo around her Omnitrix symbol. Similar to Gwen 10's pants, her own come halfway up her calf, and she wears black shoes.

                </h3>
               
                Mad Ben's Diamondhead has an almost completely black Mad Ben-style outfit with an orange belt, a small orange cross on his chest, and orange bandages on his forearms, thighs, and shins. His body is composed of pale blue crystals and like Mad Ben's Rath, he has silver spike pads with orange spikes on his knee joints, thighs, forearms, shoulders, and feet. He lacks the rear head spike that Ben Prime's Diamondhead has, but has a Mohawk consisting of three spikes instead.
