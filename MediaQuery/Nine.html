            <h2>Ben as "Upgrade"
                <hr> <br>
            </h2>

            <p>In the Original Series, Upgrade's front torso was white and the original Omnitrix symbol was on his
                chest.

                In Back with a Vengeance, Upgrade wore a yellow raincoat.

                In Destroy All Aliens, Upgrade looked the same as he did in the Original Series except he had more of a
                metallic texture, giving the appearance of a computer's screen with circuitry patterns within.

                In Ultimate Alien, Upgrade's front torso was recolored green with black circuitry patterns and the
                Ultimatrix symbol on his chest was recolored green.

                In Heroes United, Upgrade looked the same as he did in Ultimate Alien except his green circuitry stripes
                glowed yellow. His Ultimatrix symbol was also not visible until he merged with Rex.

            </p> <br>

            <p>
            <p>
                In Omniverse, 16-year-old Upgrade is more muscular, his circuit pattern has changed slightly, and the
                Omnitrix symbol is inside the ring of his eye.

                11-year-old Upgrade looks exactly the same as he did in the Original Series, except his neck is slightly
                longer and the Omnitrix symbol on his chest is recolored green.

            <h3>
                Kevin as Upgrade


            </h3>

            Kevin's Upgrade looked exactly like Ben's did in the Original Series, but without an Omnitrix symbol.
            </p> <br>

            <p>
            <h3>
                Max as Upgrade



            </h3>

            Max's Upgrade looked exactly like Ben's did in the Original Series, but was far more muscular and slightly
            taller.
            </p> <br>
