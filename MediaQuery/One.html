        <div class="box" id="content" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><h2>Ben as "Heatblast" <hr></h2>
            
            <p>Heatblast is a plasma-based life-form whose body is composed of a super hot inner plasma body covered by dark reddish brown volcanic rocks.
                 As a fire-based entity, his body radiates high amounts of heat.
                 His feet have a slight oval-like design with only two toes and one back toe. 
                 His tongue is also made of fire[5] while his collarbone resembles a volcano which generates a fiery "hair" that covers his head, leaving his mask-like face visible with no nose or ears.</p>
                 <br>
            <p>When under the effects of a cold in Side Effects, Heatblast's fiery skin (excluding his rocky body) turned blue.

                In Back with a Vengeance, Heatblast wore a yellow raincoat.
                
                4-year-old Heatblast looked the same as 10-year-old Heatblast did in the Original Series, but with a much smaller and thinner body, as well as an oversized head.
                
                In Destroy All Aliens, Heatblast looks the same as he did in the Original Series, except his plasma body glows brighter, and emits movement, similar to the Sun. The rocks show small but noticeable cracks around him, much like other minerals.
                
                In Race Against Time, Heatblast had less fire on his head and most of his head was exposed. His stone skin gained cracks of yellow glow and his plates were further apart, exposing almost parts of his plasma body. The Omnitrix symbol appeared to be embedded in his chest.
                
                In Ultimate Alien, Heatblast closely resembled Alan, only taller, not as skinny, slightly altered and his face shape was more similar to the Original Series. His eyes were no longer connected to the fire on his head. The rocks over his body changed, with a burnt black color and red markings on every edge of his rocky skin, resembling charcoal and his plasma body is a lighter shade of yellow.
                
                In Heroes United, Heatblast looked the exact same as he did in the Original Series, only his jaw was a lot lower than it was before.

                <p>
                
                In The Forge of Creation, 10-year-old Heatblast's appearance is a mix between the Ultimate Alien design and the Original Series' body color. Also, his Omnitrix symbol was green.
                
                In Omniverse, Heatblast looks the same as he did in Ultimate Alien, only his eyes are once again connected to the fire on his head, like in the Original Series. He is taller and more muscular, his face's design is different and his shoulder plates are slightly tilted up. His feet are also redesigned.
                
                When put out by water, Heatblast's plasma body was a maroon color. His rocky skin is a darker shade of red, almost pink. The flame exposes his head, however he is enveloped by a faint rising steam, possibly due to the amount of high temperature he builds up.
                
                10/11-year-old Heatblast in Omniverse looks exactly the same as his 16-year-old self, except for the fact that he is shorter and much less muscular than his sixteen-year-old self.
                
                Heatblast wears the original Omnitrix/Ultimatrix/Omnitrix symbol on his chest.

                <p>         
                    <h3>    Kevin as Heatblast</h3>   
                    Kevin's Heatblast looked the exact same as Ben's did in the Original Series, albeit he had paler skin and lacked an Omnitrix symbol.
                    </p>

                <p>
                    <h3>                    Gwen as Heatblast
                    </h3>
                    Gwen's Heatblast was leaner, her chest was larger, and her face was longer and more curved. Her forearms were considerably skinnier than Ben's Heatblast.
          
                </p>
                
                <p> <h3>                    Ben 10,000 as Heatblast
                </h3>
                Ben 10,000's Heatblast looked similar to his younger self's, but he sported two miniature volcanoes on his shoulders and had a more muscular build.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <h3>                    Alpha as Heatblast
                    </h3>
                    Alpha as Heatblast looked roughly similar to Ben 10,000's Heatblast, only his head was more monstrous. His rocky skin was more brownish. His hands and feet were animalistic. His eyes are solid red. His chest had an opening, and there was a tail-like attachment on his back. He wore the Ultimatrix symbol on his chest.</p>
