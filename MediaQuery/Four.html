XLR8 has five blue stripes on his tail and wears a black bodysuit and turtleneck-like shirt with a white stripe on the center.

                In Back with a Vengeance, XLR8 wore a yellow raincoat.
                
                In Ultimate Alien and Heroes United, XLR8 looked exactly the same as he did in the Original Series, albeit his skin was slightly darker and he was more muscular.
                
                In Omniverse, XLR8 is now taller and the white color on his shirt is replaced with green, which now covers his neck. The number of tail stripes have gone down to four, the black balls on his feet are bigger, and his visor is darker.
                
                11-year-old XLR8 in Omniverse looks exactly the same as his 16-year-old self, except that he is shorter, and the green color of his shirt is white. He has three stripes on his tail.
                
                In Rules of Engagement, XLR8 wore jewelry Fistina had stolen.
                
                XLR8 wears the original Omnitrix/Ultimatrix/Omnitrix symbol on his chest.

                    Ben 10,000 as XLR8


                </h3>
               
                Ben 10,000's XLR8 was taller and more muscular-looking than his 10-11/16-year-old self. His arms, legs and tail stripes were white instead of blue, and there were less stripes on his tail. XLR8's clothing had longer sleeves with a pair of stripes under the shoulders and has an arrow-shaped symbol on his lower torso. He wore the Omnitrix symbol on his chest.

                </h3>
               
                Ken's XLR8 looked the same as 10-year-old XLR8 in the Original Series.

                </h3>
               
                Gwen 10's XLR8 is more upright. Her face lacks the black markings that Ben's has, as they are replaced with freckles. She has pink eyes and Gwen 10's hair-clips, as well as a black helmet. The majority of her outfit is dark blue with a light blue section around her neck that goes down her chest in a V-formation, light blue stripes on her forearms and wrists, two light blue stripes on the end of her tail, and a light blue stripe on each of her legs where the outfit ends. Her visor now has pink markings, and her hands are more human-shaped with claws for fingers. She wears the Omnitrix symbol on her chest with a cat shape surrounding it.
