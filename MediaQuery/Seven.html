            <h2>Ben as "StinkFly"
                <hr> <br>
            </h2>

            <p>Stinkfly has a bug/insect body and four insect-like flat legs with two arms, whose hands are human-style
                ones with three clawed fingers. He has four small eyes on long stalks connected to his large head, which
                can all be moved around independently from each other. His wings are light green and very fragile with
                lines on them, and his limbs are a brown-greenish color. His tail is an ultra sensitive receptor, making
                it like an antenna.

            </p> <br>

            <p>
            <p>
                In the Original Series, Stinkfly wore a white sleeveless jumpsuit with black lining which covered most
                of his body including his head and tail, his hands had a black coloration similar to fingerless gloves,
                and his eyes were yellowish-orange. His mouth has a tongue and gums that are green in coloration, and he
                had squarish teeth that interlocked when closed. He wore the Omnitrix symbol on the top of his
                forehead.
                In Ultimate Alien, Stinkfly's eyes were recolored green and he did not have fingerless gloves. The shine
                on his limbs was also removed. 16-year-old Stinkfly wore the Ultimatrix symbol on his chest in the
                Ultimate Alien intro, though it was on his forehead in Heroes United.

            <h3>
                Kevin as Stinkfly


            </h3>

            Kevin's Stinkfly looked the exact same as Ben's did in the Original Series, but with a darker color scheme
            and without an Omnitrix symbol.
            </p> <br>

            <h3>
                Ben 10,000 as Stinkfly


            </h3>

            Ben 10,000's Stinkfly's body style was almost the same as his 10-year-old self, with the only differences
            being that his eyes were longer with black pupils, his stinger and legs were larger, and his clothes were in
            inverted colors similar to Ben 10,000's first outfit.
