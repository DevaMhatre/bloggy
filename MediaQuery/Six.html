            <h2>Ben as "Four Arms"
                <hr> <br>
            </h2>

            <p>Four Arms is a humanoid alien that is ten feet tall.[merch 2][note 1] He has well-developed muscles, two
                pairs of four-fingered arms, and red skin. A black stripe goes from his chin to his lower lip, and he
                has four eyes: a main pair and a smaller pair below them, while he lacks ears or nose. He has
                whisker-like spikes on each forearm.

            </p> <br>

            <p>
            <p>
                16-year-old Four Arms has three short spikes on the top of his head, a mustache-like design, the black
                stripe on the top of his head is replaced with small spikes and the same second set of pectorals as his
                11-year-old self. He has no hair and wears a black tank top-like shirt with one large green stripe in
                the middle, black pants, a green and white belt where the Omnitrix symbol is located, and black
                fingerless gloves with green cuffs at the wrists.

            <h3>
                Kevin as Four Arms


            </h3>

            Kevin's Four Arms looked the same as Ben's did in the Original Series, but with paler skin and no Omnitrix
            symbol.
            </p> <br>

            <p>
            <h3>
                Gwen as Four Arms


            </h3>

            Four Arms had darker skin, hair and clothes based on Gwen's, and lacked the vertical black stripe sported by
            Ben's version. Just like Ben, Gwen's Four Arms wore the Omnitrix symbol on her upper left shoulder.
            </p> <br>

            <h3>
                Ben 10,000 as Four Arms



            </h3>

            Ben 10,000's Four Arms had a better-developed forehead, more muscle mass, a different T-shirt design and a
            pair of jutting incisors. He wore the Omnitrix symbol on his chest. </p> <br>
